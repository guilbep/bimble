# ADR 0036 — Detail levels (Nanite-like clusters): not yet; what would make them worth it

- Status: Proposed (9 Nov 2026) — to decide with Pierre
- Decided by: — (Pierre asked to look at it: "6 (Nanite-style detail levels)")
- Reversal cost: n/a

## Context / Problem

Virtualized geometry (Unreal's Nanite; open versions: Bevy's meshlets, meshoptimizer's
`clusterlod`, nanite-webgpu) splits meshes into ~128-triangle clusters arranged in a hierarchy
of simplified levels, and draws, per frame, the coarsest level whose error stays under a pixel,
culled per cluster (frustum, occlusion). It keeps frame time near-constant whatever the triangle
count.

Where Bimble stands after ADR 0034/0035 (1080p, MSAA 4, M4 Pro, `bimble bench`):

| model | triangles drawn | stored | full frame | moving (3 px) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 200 MB electrical | 8.8 M | 0.38 M | 7.7 ms | 0.6 ms |
| 872 MB plumbing | 9.1 M | 5.5 M | 7.5 ms | 1.6 ms |
| 758 MB sanitary | 21.0 M | 4.3 M | 17.8 ms | 1.6 ms |
| 415 MB sprinklers | 35.8 M | ~2.7 M | 33.9 ms | 3.2 ms |

## Assessment (not decided)

- **What it would add:** stills of the largest models at full rate (today 30 fps for 35.8 M
  triangles) and smooth orbiting without things disappearing (ADR 0035 drops small elements).
- **Cost:** high. A cluster builder and simplifier (meshoptimizer is C: building it for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is unverified), a cluster hierarchy per shape (shared by instances),
  per-cluster culling, and for real gains GPU-driven draws — compute and indirect draws that
  WebGL2 doesn't have (multi-draw-indirect is not in WebGPU either, only native wgpu).
- **Fit for BIM:** IFC elements are low-poly and many; simplifying each one gains little. The
  triangles are in fittings and pipes (already instanced) and in faceted breps. Hierarchical LOD of
  *spatial cells* (merged proxies of what is far away) fits better than per-mesh clusters.
- **Cheaper steps first,** each measurable:
  1. Frustum culling per element and per shape draw through the box tree (ADR 0034): nothing is
     drawn off screen (today every buffer is drawn; the GPU clips).
  2. Indexed shapes (positions welded, 16-bit indices for shapes under 65 536 vertices):
     about half the GPU bytes per shape triangle.
  3. Dedup of geometry the file didn't instance (IfcOpenShell's `MeshDedup`: bucket, invariants,
     Kabsch fit) — the 872 MB model is 55 % unshared breps.
  4. Measure on a weak GPU (an integrated GPU, a software adapter, WebGL2) before going further.

## Revisit when

- A weak GPU or WebGL2 measurement shows full frames over 50 ms on a real model after steps 1–3.
- Models over ~100 M drawn triangles arrive (multi-GB IFC).
- WebGPU gets multi-draw-indirect, or the browser target is dropped for such models.
